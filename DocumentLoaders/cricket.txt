**Ode to Cricket**

Beneath the sun on fields of green,
Where willow waltzes with a seam,
The crowd holds breath, the silence tight—
Then bat meets ball, and day turns bright.

Eleven hearts with hope aligned,
In flannel whites, with dreams entwined,
Each run a tale, each catch a fight,
Each over spun with pure delight.

The bowler storms with eyes aflame,
A craftsman bent on shaping game,
He twists the air, he tempts the edge,
With pace or spin, he makes his pledge.

The batsman waits, the world is still,
A single stroke can bend the will,
Of fate and foe, of loss and gain,
A boundary cuts through joy and pain.

From dusty lanes to grandest stage,
From childhood games to legends’ age,
Cricket’s soul beats loud and true,
In every cheer, in skies of blue.

It’s not just sport, but art and lore,
A rhythm old, a timeless score,
A gentleman’s war, with quiet might—
Cricket, our passion, our endless light.
